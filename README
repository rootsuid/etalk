Etalk
=======

This is a very simple chat daemon using SSL and curses. It's written in python.
The default port is 1776.

Status
=======
Messy prototype. I wrote it because my github was new and empty - and I hadn't used curses in python before.
The curses interface is a bit finicky.


Usage
=======
As host:
  ./etalk - start curses interface and wait for a connection (the screen will split when your user connects)

As client:
  ./etalk 5.4.1.2 - connect to some machine
  ./etalk 5.4.1.2 1776 - connect on a custom port

Keys:
  F5 - refresh curses windows
  Control+C - quit
